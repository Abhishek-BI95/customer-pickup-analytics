# 📊 Customer Pick-Up Analytics (CPU) – Power BI Project

This repository showcases a **Customer Pick-Up (CPU) analytics solution** built using **Power BI, SQL, and Excel/Power Query**.  
The goal of this project is to monitor and improve **CPU compliance, response time, and pending orders** across warehouses, helping operations teams make **data-driven decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The CPU dashboard focuses on:

- **CPU Compliance %** – How many CPU orders meet the check-in/response SLA.
- **Customer Response Time** – Time between customer check-in and first response.
- **Pending CPU Orders** – Orders that are ready/past due but not yet completed.
- **Warehouse-Level Performance** – Comparing CPU metrics across different branches.
- **Daily Trends** – Tracking performance over time for continuous improvement.

This project reflects how I work with **data, stakeholders, and operations teams** to design useful dashboards.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design.
- **SQL** – Data extraction, filtering, and summarization from source systems.
- **Power Query (M)** – Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Excel** – Quick analysis, validation, and mockups.

# Stakeholder Workflow – CPU Dashboard

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - Met with **Operations, Warehouse Leads, and Managers** to understand:
     - What CPU metrics are important.
     - Which delays cause the most impact.
     - What they want to see daily vs weekly.

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Coordinated with **IT / BI team** to:
     - Identify source tables (CPU orders, check-in logs, response logs).
     - Confirm field definitions (status, timestamps, warehouse, carrier, etc.).
     - Align on refresh frequency.

3. **Prototype & Feedback**
   - Built an initial **Power BI mockup** with:
     - CPU compliance trend.
     - Response time distribution.
     - Pending orders summary.
   - Collected feedback from stakeholders and refined visuals/KPIs.

4. **Finalization & Handover**
   - Documented KPIs, data model, and logic.
   - Walked stakeholders through the dashboard.
   - Provided guidance on filters, slicers, and daily usage.

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Ongoing feedback loop to:
     - Add new views (e.g., product line, carrier).
     - Refine thresholds and highlight rules.
